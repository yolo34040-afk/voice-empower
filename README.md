## Inspiration

Many of us know the pain of freezing up when it’s our turn to speak — in class, in interviews, or in public.
We realized how communication anxiety silently holds back opportunities. SpeakUp was born from that experience — a way to practice speaking in a judgment-free zone.

## How It Works

- New users sign up and take a quick speaking assessment.

- Based on the result, the app suggests custom prompts that match their comfort level.

- Users upload recordings of their speeches.

- SpeakUp’s AI gives instant, constructive feedback.

- Over time, users can track their progress and build confidence.
